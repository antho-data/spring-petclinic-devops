# Distributed version of the Spring PetClinic 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This microservices branch was initially derived from the [microservices version](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices) to demonstrate how to split sample Spring application into [microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).
To achieve that goal we use Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, Spring Cloud Config, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Resilience4j, Micrometer and the Eureka Service Discovery from the [Spring Cloud Netflix](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix) technology stack. While running on Kubernetes, some components (such as Spring Cloud Config and Eureka Service Discovery) are replaced with Kubernetes-native features such as config maps and Kubernetes DNS resolution.


## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application

### Settings up databases with helm

We'll now need to deploy our databases. For that, we'll use helm. You'll need helm 3 and above since we're not using Tiller in this deployment.

Make sure you have a single `default` StorageClass in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
✗ kubectl get sc
NAME                 PROVISIONER            AGE
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd   6h11m

```

Deploy the databases:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install vets-db-mysql bitnami/mysql --namespace spring-petclinic --version 8.8.8 --set auth.database=service_instance_db
helm install visits-db-mysql bitnami/mysql --namespace spring-petclinic  --version 8.8.8 --set auth.database=service_instance_db
helm install customers-db-mysql bitnami/mysql --namespace spring-petclinic  --version 8.8.8 --set auth.database=service_instance_db
```

### Deploying the application

Our deployment YAMLs have a placeholder called `REPOSITORY_PREFIX` so we'll be able to deploy the images from any Docker registry. Sadly, Kubernetes doesn't support environment variables in the YAML descriptors. We have a small script to do it for us and run our deployments:

```bash
./scripts/deployToKubernetes.sh
```

Verify the pods are deployed:

```bash
✗ kubectl get pods -n spring-petclinic 
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
api-gateway-585fff448f-q45jc         1/1     Running   0          4m20s
customers-db-mysql-0                 1/1     Running   0          11m
customers-service-5d7d686654-kpcmx   1/1     Running   0          4m19s
vets-db-mysql-0                      1/1     Running   0          11m
vets-service-85cb8677df-l5xpj        1/1     Running   0          4m2s
visits-db-mysql-0                    1/1     Running   0          11m
visits-service-654fffbcc7-zj2jw      1/1     Running   0          4m2s
wavefront-proxy-dfbd4b695-fdd6t      1/1     Running   0          14m
```

Get the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the API Gateway:

```bash
✗ kubectl get svc -n spring-petclinic api-gateway 
NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
api-gateway   LoadBalancer   10.7.250.24   34.1.2.22   80:32675/TCP   18m
```

You can now browse to that IP in your browser and see the application running.

You should also see monitoring and traces from Wavefront under the application name `spring-petclinic-k8s`:

## Starting services locally without Docker

Every microservice is a Spring Boot application and can be started locally using IDE 
or `../mvnw spring-boot:run -Plocal` command.
Remember to enable the `local` Maven profile.

Please note that supporting services (Config and Discovery Server) must be started before any other application (Customers, Vets, Visits and API).
Startup of Tracing server, Admin server, Grafana and Prometheus is optional.
If everything goes well, you can access the following services at given location:

* Discovery Server - http://localhost:8761
* Config Server - http://localhost:8888
* AngularJS frontend (API Gateway) - http://localhost:8080
* Customers, Vets and Visits Services - random port, check Eureka Dashboard 
* Tracing Server (Zipkin) - http://localhost:9411/zipkin/ (we use [openzipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server))
* Admin Server (Spring Boot Admin) - http://localhost:9090
* Grafana Dashboards - http://localhost:3000
* Prometheus - http://localhost:9091

You can tell Config Server to use your local Git repository by using `native` Spring profile and setting
`GIT_REPO` environment variable, for example:
`-Dspring.profiles.active=native -DGIT_REPO=/projects/spring-petclinic-microservices-config`

## Starting services locally with docker-compose

In order to start entire infrastructure using Docker, you have to build images by executing `./mvnw clean install -P buildDocker` 
from a project root. Once images are ready, you can start them with a single command
`docker-compose up`. Containers startup order is coordinated with [`dockerize` script](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize). 
After starting services it takes a while for API Gateway to be in sync with service registry,
so don't be scared of initial Spring Cloud Gateway timeouts. You can track services availability using Eureka dashboard
available by default at http://localhost:8761.

The `master` branch uses an  Alpine linux  with JRE 8 as Docker base. You will find a Java 11 version in the `release/java11` branch.

*NOTE: Under MacOSX or Windows, make sure that the Docker VM has enough memory to run the microservices. The default settings
are usually not enough and make the `docker-compose up` painfully slow.*


## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic Microservices

Our issue tracker is available here: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud/issues

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which gets populated at startup with data.
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Dependency for Connector/J, the MySQL JDBC driver is already included in the `pom.xml` files.

### Start a MySql database

You may start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```
or download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.7 GA), which can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

### Use the Spring 'mysql' profile

To use a MySQL database, you have to start 3 microservices (`visits-service`, `customers-service` and `vets-services`)
with the `mysql` Spring profile. Add the `--spring.profiles.active=mysql` as programm argument.

By default, at startup, database schema will be created and data will be populated.
You may also manually create the PetClinic database and data by executing the `"db/mysql/{schema,data}.sql"` scripts of each 3 microservices. 
In the `application.yml` of the [Configuration repository], set the `initialization-mode` to `never`.

If you are running the microservices with Docker, you have to add the `mysql` profile into the (Dockerfile)[docker/Dockerfile]:
```
ENV SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE docker,mysql
```
In the `mysql section` of the `application.yml` from the [Configuration repository], you have to change 
the host and port of your MySQL JDBC connection string. 

## Custom metrics monitoring

Grafana and Prometheus are included in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration, and the public facing applications
have been instrumented with [MicroMeter](https://micrometer.io) to collect JVM and custom business metrics.

A JMeter load testing script is available to stress the application and generate metrics: [petclinic_test_plan.jmx](spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/test/jmeter/petclinic_test_plan.jmx)

![Grafana metrics dashboard](docs/grafana-custom-metrics-dashboard.png)

### Using Prometheus

* Prometheus can be accessed from your local machine at http://localhost:9091

### Using Grafana with Prometheus

* An anonymous access and a Prometheus datasource are setup.
* A `Spring Petclinic Metrics` Dashboard is available at the URL http://localhost:3000/d/69JXeR0iw/spring-petclinic-metrics.
You will find the JSON configuration file here: [docker/grafana/dashboards/grafana-petclinic-dashboard.json]().
* You may create your own dashboard or import the [Micrometer/SpringBoot dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701) via the Import Dashboard menu item.
The id for this dashboard is `4701`.

### Custom metrics
Spring Boot registers a lot number of core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback... 
The Spring Boot auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC.
All those three REST controllers `OwnerResource`, `PetResource` and `VisitResource` have been instrumented by the `@Timed` Micrometer annotation at class level.

* `customers-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.owner`
  * @Timed: `petclinic.pet`
* `visits-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.visit`

## Interesting Spring Petclinic forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [spring-petclinic-cloud](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud/) project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
